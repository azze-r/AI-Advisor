What is stigmatisation ? 

LLama3 :

Based on the provided context, I understand that stigmatization refers to a process 
 that occurs when certain elements, such as labelling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, 
 and discrimination, happen together in a power situation. This leads to prejudicial effects on 
 individuals, including damage to their role in society, treatment in mental health services, 
 and overall well-being.

Stigmatization leads to individual and social discrimination against the stigmatized person.  
Several authors identify that the discriminatory behaviour displayed can be and discrimination occur 
together in a power situation that allows these processes to happen (Link and Phelan 2001). 
The provided text defines stigmatization as a process that leads to individual and social discrimination 
against a person based on their perceived status or characteristic.
